Today, a new version of Flamenco Manager and Worker (both versions 2.1.0) introduces more control
over your Workers from the Flamenco Manager dashboard. You can now send Workers to **sleep**, wake
them up when needed, or shut them down, all from the dashboard.

Workers can now be started in **single task** mode, in which they automatically stop running after,
well, executing a single task. This can be useful for short-lived machines like Google's preemptive
compute nodes.

Before introducing a new Worker to your render farm, you can now start it in **test mode**. This
will allow the Manager to send a simple test render job to the Worker and make sure that it's set up
correctly, before it starts accepting real tasks.

For more details, checkout the
[Flamenco Manager changelog](https://github.com/armadillica/flamenco-manager/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
and
[Flamenco Worker changelog](https://github.com/armadillica/flamenco-worker-python/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
