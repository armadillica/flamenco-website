Today, a new version of Flamenco Manager, version 2.1.1, was released. It polishes the web
interface, fixes some Firefox compatibility issues, and adds some extra features. For me personally
it's nice that we now build with the just-released [Go 1.10](https://golang.org/); for end users
this doesn't matter much.

## New stuff

- Log a warning when backslashes are used in path replacement variables. Those should not be used,
  but forward slashes should be used for every platform.
- Allow erasing idle workers from the dashboard.
- Show 'last seen' timestamp in idle workers tooltip on the dashboard.
- Added `job_storage` path replacement variable to default configuration. This variable is used by
  the test system introduced in [Flamenco Manager 2.1.0](https://www.flamenco.io/blog/2018/1/2018-01-04-new-release-210/),
  so it's nice to actually have it available for configuration by default. Of course if you already
  have any configuration you don't get this default, so it's up to you to add it.

## Polish and fixes

- Fixed race condition in JavaScript loading.
- Fixed incompatibility of "latest image" server-side event system with Firefox.
- Limit display height of last-rendered image to 300 pixels.
