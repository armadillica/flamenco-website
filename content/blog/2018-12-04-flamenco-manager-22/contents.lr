Today, a new version of Flamenco Manager, version 2.2, was released. It has some new functionality
that requires [Flamenco Server](https://developer.blender.org/diffusion/F/) to be updated to 2.1 or
newer (which is the case on [Blender Cloud](https://cloud.blender.org/)).

## New stuff

- Send the set of task types supported by our workers to Flamenco Server. This will allow it to
  tailor some variable jobs to our capabilities.
- Include upstream queue size on dashboard. This can aid debugging networking/performance issues.
- Allow Workers to return tasks to the queue for re-executing later.
- Store log entries in local files on the Manager, instead of sending all of them to the Server.
  The log files are stored in a directory per job, and a file per task. When a task is restarted,
  its log file is rotated (`{task-id}.log` becomes `{task-id}.log.1`). There is no automatic
  cleanup of log files implemented; this can be handled by a system daemon or by manual deletion.
  Log files can be accessed at http://your-manager/logfile/{job-id}/{task-id}. Requires Flamenco
  Server version 2.1 or newer.

## Fixes

- Accept log entries for tasks that are no longer runnable. In this case the task's status and
  activity doesn't change, but the logs are still accepted & forwarded to Flamenco Server. This
  helps to figure out why a task failed, even when the logs are lagging behind.
