Yesterday Flamenco Server 2.2, Manager 2.4, and Flamenco Worker 2.3 have been released. The new
releases contain all kind of improvements we built & used during the production of
[Spring](https://cloud.blender.org/p/spring). Of course [Blender Cloud](https://cloud.blender.org/)
has already been updated to Flamenco Server 2.2.

For more details, see the changelog files of Flamenco
[Server](https://developer.blender.org/diffusion/F/browse/master/CHANGELOG.md;v2.2?as=remarkup),
[Manager](https://developer.blender.org/source/flamenco-manager/browse/master/CHANGELOG.md;v2.4?as=remarkup), and
[Worker](https://developer.blender.org/source/flamenco-worker/browse/master/CHANGELOG.md;v2.3?as=remarkup).

**Download [Flamenco Manager and Worker](https://flamenco.io/download)** and get started today. All
Blender Cloud subscribers can use our [Cloud-hosted Flamenco Server](https://cloud.blender.org/flamenco)
as part of their subscription.

[Flamenco channel on Blender Chat](https://blender.chat/channel/flamenco) and get help from professionals.


## Flamenco Server

- New interface for the job list overview, based on Vue.js. It now allows filtering and
  sorting jobs.
- The web interface now shows the reason why a task has a certain status (for example, "Status set
  to requeued by Dr. Sybren").
- Job settings can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on them. Variables are automatically
  expanded for the platform of the browser.
- Users can now use the Flamenco Server web interface to request a Task Log file from the Manager.
  This allows access to the task logs without requiring direct access to the Manager.
- Added `blender-video-chunks` job type, meant for encoding the edit of a film from the video
  sequence editor. In the Blender Cloud add-on, configure it to use Matroska, MOV, or MP4 video and
  be sure to configure an audio codec if you want audio to be in the final file. It renders the
  frames, combines them into chunks of videos, then concatenates those video chunks together into
  one and muxes the audio into it. The output file is nameed it with the current date, a counter to
  make the filename unique, and the name of the blend file.
- Progressive Blender Render jobs are smarter in the way they distribute samples. The initial tasks
  render a small amount of samples (so that you quickly have a preview), whereas later tasks have
  many more samples (so that they don't have to restart Blender too often). This is a
  backward-incompatible change, and requires an upgrade of both the Blender Cloud add-on (1.12+),
  Flamenco Worker (2.3+), and Blender 2.80 from after 2019-01-30.
- The EXR merging of Progressive Rendering jobs is now done in one task per render iteration
  (instead of one task per frame chunk). The entire EXR sequence is now merged in one run of
  Blender.
- New job status `waiting-for-files` allows a job to be created before the job's files are put into
  place. Jobs that are not updated for 24h and still in `waiting-for-files` status are automatically
  and irrevocably deleted.
- Blender Render jobs no longer create preview videos for single-frame render jobs.


## Flamenco Manager

- [Shaman Server](https://www.flamenco.io/docs/user_manual/shaman/) has been integrated into
  Flamenco Manager, which makes file transfers for Flamenco render jobs much more efficient. Use
  `shaman://your-flamenco-manager/` as Job Storage location in the Blender Cloud add-on to use it.
- Flamenco Manager's dashboard and log files can now be protected with JWT access tokens.
  These tokens are handed out by Flamenco Server, and only to those users who have the right
  to use that particular Flamenco Manager.
- Improved failure handling. When a task is failed by a worker, it moves to status
  `soft-failed` and will be retried by another worker. Only after three such failures
  by three different workers (or if your farm has run out of workers to retry the task)
  will the task go to status `failed`. This allows that one machine with a bit less memory
  than the rest to still join your farm and work on less memory-intensive shots.
- Offline workers can be auto-removed from the Flamenco Manager database. This allows for
  cloud-based rendering on suddenly-disappearing low-priority machines, without filling
  up your Manager dashboard with old workers.
- The Manager's name as shown on its Dashboard is configurable, to allow distinguishing
  between different render farms.
- Worker registration can be secured with a pre-shared secret.
- Flamenco Manager can now be restarted into Web Setup mode from the dashboard.
- Restarting Flamenco Manager on POSIX-compliant systems (Linux, macOS) now happens
  'in-place'; the PID remains the same and the process stays attached to the same
  shell (if running from a shell). Systemd does not notice this restart.


## Upcoming improvements

- The access token based protection of Flamenco Manager's dashboard isn't applied to the
  web-based setup yet. This will be implemented in Flamenco Manager 2.5.
- [Variables and path replacement variables](https://www.flamenco.io/docs/user_manual/installation/#manager-configuration)
  will be unified and clarified, and will become more powerful.
